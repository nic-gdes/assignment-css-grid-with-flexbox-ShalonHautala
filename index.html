            <p>
                With a strong background in construction and excavation, I have a unique advantage, 
                offering insights that set me apart from my peers. My experience includes physically working 
                on drain fields, septic systems, and sewer lines, as well as the ability to identify roofing 
                types and explain radon systems. I also evaluates electrical panel boxes and am well-versed
                in issues like recalled Federal Pacific brands and LP siding lawsuits.
